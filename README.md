# Favorite Songs Portfolio 🎵

Welcome to my **Favorite Songs Portfolio**!  

This webpage showcases my **top 5 favorite songs** that have inspired and comforted me over the years. Each song includes a personal note describing why it is meaningful, along with a **clickable thumbnail** that links directly to the YouTube video.  

The portfolio is designed to be **clean, responsive, and visually appealing**, featuring a soft pink background and styled song description blocks.  

Built using **HTML5** and **CSS3**, this project is perfect for sharing on GitHub Pages or LinkedIn, highlighting both my **web development skills** and my **personal interests**.
